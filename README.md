 Stock Price Prediction using LSTMAdd commentMore actions
Predict stock price trends with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This project demonstrates how AI can forecast time-series data, providing a real-life example of AI in finance.
## 🚩 Problem Statement
Predicting stock trends can help users make smarter investments. Can we use AI to forecast stock prices based on historical data?
## 🎯 Objective
- Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to forecast stock prices.
- Visualize actual vs. predicted prices to estimate future trends.
## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Historical stock data** from Yahoo Finance (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, AMZN).
- Data includes: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- yfinance
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorflow / keras
## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Preprocessing:** 
    - Normalize and reshape data for LSTM input.
    - Create sequences for time-series prediction.
3. **Modeling:** Build and train an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Evaluation:** Plot actual vs. predicted prices.
